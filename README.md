# AuraCSS - Keep it Simple
> AuraCSS is in active development and may change frequently. Make sure to check in every now and then to make sure your verison is up to date with the latest features.

AuraCSS is a relatively simple CSS/SCSS framework. It was build as I personally really dislike Bootstrap and like Tailwind. The idea behind this framework is to be a "Hybrid"
between Bootstap and Tailwind. Containing some basic modules like Bootstrap but also haivng the option to add countless utility classes to improve the look fo your site.
