# Responsiveness
This framework relies partially on you to set how you want you page to look. There are a bunch of options on how you could want something. Below is a table showing all sizes.
| Option | Size    |
|--------|---------|
| xs     | <575px  |
| s      | <767px  |
| m      | <1199px |

Now, to use these sizes, they must be applied to Columns. This is done simply by checking the table below.
| Size | Size (based on parent component) |
|------|----------------------------------|
| s100 | 100%                             |
| s90* | 90%                              |
| s75  | 75%                              |
| s66  | 66%                              |
| s50  | 50%                              |
| s33  | 33%                              |
| s25  | 25%                              |
| none | 0% (not visible)                 |

Combine this with the sizes and you have the option for a fully responsive website! For example: "div.col.s100" = 100%
